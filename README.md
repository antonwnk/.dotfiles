# .dotfiles REPOSITORY

This is a personal repository that _is supposed_ to track shell (& essentials) config files I use on a day-to-day basis. It's intended to be a WIP in perpetuity.


# Prerequisites (or rather assumptions)

The repository consists of config files for [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), and [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim). Several other binaries/tools are expected to be present in order to fully configure the aforementioned. These are:
- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/burntsushi/ripgrep)
- [nodejs](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (for nvim LSPs)
